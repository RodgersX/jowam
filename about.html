				<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
				  	<li>From cooperative society factory where berries are washed, processed,
				  	 dried and stored, we move to private and state-owned coffee millers for another level
				  	 of quality assurance by hulling dried coffee beans, grading/screening
				  	 by size (AA, AB, C, E, HE, PB, SB, T, TT, UG, UG1, UG2, and UG3), shape, colour and weight.
				  	 They label beans according to beans source farm, cooperative, plantation or
				  	 garden for ascertaining FCS domestic collector/dealer connectivity with actual farmers.</li>

				  	<li>Coffee millers, Coffee Board of Kenya, and Nairobi Coffee Exchange confirm local
				  	 consumption and export coffee beans and standardization involved to all exporting cooperatives,
				  	 private exporting companies, direct foreign buyers, government export agencies and all coffee dealers involved in the process.</li>

				  	<li>The warehouse log trace coffee beans from the farm where they were produced,
				  	  cooperative society factory where wet/dry pulping was processed and miller where hulling,
				  	  grading and packaging was done. The above rigorous process also includes
				  	  all FLO (Fairtrade), UTZ, CAFE, 4C and RA certification standards which forms part
				  	  of quality authenticity measures. The coffee traded is Utz Certified (Amsterdam standards);
				  	  Caf Certified (Sturbacks std); nationally Kenya Bureau of standards,
				  	  and we are currently other ISO standards. In order to ensure quality, we have a fully equipped
				  	  coffee-liquoring laboratory where all the coffee is analyzed in preparation for export.</li>

				  	<li>Roasters and coffee connoisseurs through their quality roasting and grinding do their thorough
				  	 cupping rituals to return the same good quality verdict. Quality roasting equipment and
				  	 experienced connoisseurs do routinely and randomly sample our export coffee beans
				  	 for assurance of our coffee export. The coffee is specially blended to bring out all the characteristics
				  	 that give Kenyan coffee its worldwide reputation for outstanding quality and flavor.
				  	 All our green coffees are carefully processed prior to roasting.</li>

				  	 <li>We, Jowam Trading Coffee Exporters, are committed to managing health, safety and environmental (HS&E) matters
				  	  involved in the process as an integral part of our business.  It is the company policy to assure
				  	  the HS&E integrity of our processes and facilities at all times and all places.
				  	  We are adhering to the following principles:
				  	  	<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				  	  		<li>We are complying with all applicable laws and regulations and will implement programmes
				  	  		 and procedures to assure compliance.  Strict compliance with HS&E standards are key ingredient
				  	  		 in the training, performance reviews and incentives of all our employees.
				  	  		 Where, existing laws and regulations are not adequate to assure protection of human health,
				  	  		 safety and the environment, we do establish and meet our own HS&E quality standards.</li>

				  	  		 <li>We are employing management systems and procedures specifically designed to prevent activities
				  	  		  and or conditions that pose a threat to human health, safety or the environment.
				  	  		  We are minimizing risk and protect our employees and the communities in which we operate by
				  	  		  employing safe technologies and operating procedures, as well as being prepared for emergencies.
				  	  		  We will strive to prevent releases to the atmosphere, land or water.
				  	  		  We will minimize the amount and toxicity of waste generated and will ensure the safe treatment and disposal of waste.</li>

				  	  		  <li>We are communicating our commitment to HS&E quality to our employee, vendors and customers.
				  	  		   We are soliciting their input in meeting our HS&E goals and in turn will offer assistance to meet their goals.</li>

				  	  		   <li>We are continuously seeking opportunities to improve our differences to these
				  	  		    principles and are periodically reporting progress to our stakeholders.</li>

            <p class="mb-0">Quality coffee delivery on your breakfast table start from human, donkeys,
    				carts and pickups delivering ripe red cherry to cooperative society factories for pulping,
    				washing and sun drying. From here they are then transported to private and state-owned
    				coffee mills for hulling, grading/screening, and certifications such as FLO, UTZ, RA, and 4C whenever is necessary.
    				For us at Jowam Trading Coffee, delivery start from farmers’ farm inputs, cooperatives’
    				wet/dry processing, marketing agents’ and millers’ milling and grading, and warehouses’ handling.
    				Then we move to coffee auctioning, shipping and customs’ documentation, and the final destination monitoring for the clients.
    				Here is a warehousing service provider, which on behalf of us and our final customers takes custody of coffee,
    				and general food items and provides value addition services and logistical services suited to meet its customer requirements. 
            For the above shipping process to be seemless and operational, we initially propose to our clients
    				our partners involved: Bollore Africa (K) Ltd, TNT, FedEx to deliver our green coffee beans.
    				Our esteemed clients too are given a choice of their own logistics mode preference
    				as long as the shipping line, clearing & forwarding, and courier services agents are reputable,
    				reliable and do have local branch offices in Kenya (Mombasa or Nairobi).
    				Lastly, concise documentation from the farm, cooperative societies, coffee millers,
    				coffee exchange, clearing and forwarding, insurance and bankers are up to standards.</p>
